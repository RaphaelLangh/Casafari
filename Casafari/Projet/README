  dataImport module : 
    for each .csv file, I create a SQLlite table  
  
  question1 module :
    In question1, I used a SQL instruction to get the data from my 3 tables
   
  question2 module :
   The idea is to generate for any real estate a model that predict the price at a date (YYYY-MM) and to calculate the average
   the model I use is a linear model (sklearn) 
   
   I get the training data with the function "data_extraction", caculate the model for one real estate with "regress1" and iterate for any real estate
   with "regresstot" and predict the average price with "predict_average"
   
   question3 module :
   I select the data with "data_extraction" and use pyplot from matplotlib to generate a scatter plot
